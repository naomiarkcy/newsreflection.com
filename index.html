                            According to him, the operation was part of efforts to flush out criminal elements disturbing the peace in Kaduna.
                            He explained that police operatives, in collaboration with the military, the Department of State Services and local vigilantes, launched a coordinated raid on criminal hideouts in the Kawo area.

                        <p>The joint operation, led to the arrest of the suspects and also recovered a cache of weapons and illicit substances from the suspects. 
                            Among the items recovered were knives, axes, cutlasses, as well as large quantities of dried leaves suspected to be Indian hemp and other hard drugs.
                            Commissioner of Police, CP Rabiu Muhammad, reaffirmed the Command's commitment to maintaining law and order across Kaduna State.

                            He stressed that the Command would continue to pursue and dismantle all criminal networks that pose a threat to public safety and the peace of residents.
                            The Commissioner further warned individuals or groups intending to disrupt public order to desist or vacate the state, stating that the police would give no room for miscreants to operate.
                            He also urged the public to remain vigilant and cooperate with law enforcement agencies in the ongoing fight against crime.
                            It would be recalled that the  Naval officer was reportedly stabbed to death by assailants after refusing to surrender his phone along Kawo.
