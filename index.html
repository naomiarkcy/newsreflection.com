                            According to him, the operation was part of efforts to flush out criminal elements disturbing the peace in Kaduna.
                            He explained that police operatives, in collaboration with the military, the Department of State Services and local vigilantes, launched a coordinated raid on criminal hideouts in the Kawo area.

                        <p>The joint operation, led to the arrest of the suspects and also recovered a cache of weapons and illicit substances from the suspects.

                            He also urged the public to remain vigilant and cooperate with law enforcement agencies in the ongoing fight against crime.
                            It would be recalled that the  Naval officer was reportedly stabbed to death by assailants after refusing to surrender his phone along Kawo.
