               Rising from its monthly congress held at the NUJ Secretariat on Monday, the union said the Taskforce must be strengthened and properly equipped to flush out criminal elements and secure flashpoints across Kaduna metropolis and other vulnerable parts of the state.


               In a communiqué signed by Usman Sani (Chairman), Lola Seriki-Idahosa (Member) and Ango Bally (Secretary), the NUJ expressed concern that many areas remained unsafe, forcing people to adjust daily routines and business hours out of fear of attacks.

It noted that bad roads not only hurt commerce but sometimes heighten security risks by isolating communities and slowing response by security agencies.

               Among the roads cited by the journalists for urgent attention were the Kabala Costain–Nuhu Aliyu Road in Barnawa; Television Garage–Sabon Tasha; Sabon Tasha–Unguwan Gimbiya–Juji Road; Kakuri–Nasarawa; and Kabala West–Hayin Nariya Road.

               It identified poverty, lack of access to education and social exclusion as key drivers of the problem, and urged the government to expand school enrolment programmes and alternative livelihood schemes for vulnerable families.

               The Council, however, commended the improved working relationship between the Kaduna State Government and the media, describing it as healthy for democracy and good governance. It urged both parties to deepen engagements to sustain the gains.
